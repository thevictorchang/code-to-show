To the lovely interviewer,

As Greg may have explained, I don't actually have any coding projects that I could show - I don't do any programming outside of work and I'm sure you'll understand that I am unable to bring in software projects from my current or previous roles.

I've attached a couple of challenges I've done on Hackerrank - I tend to either write pretty self-documenting code or have very useful comments to go along. When I develop, I have a strong focus on making the codebase as pleasant to work on for the next person.

I completed these challenges using python - I tend to use Python (or Javascript) for small scripting problems, but my larger-scale language of choice is C#.

If you have any questions, just ask!

 - Victor
